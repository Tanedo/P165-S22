\section{\texorpdfstring{Total Momentum Conservation for a $2\to 3$ process}{Total Momentum Conservation for a Two-to-Three Process}}

The following diagram is one contribution to the process $e^+ e^- \to 3\gamma$:

\end{center}
Using the conservation of four-momentum at each vertex, show that the total four-momentum is conserved. That is, prove:
\begin{align}
	(p_1 + p_2)^\mu = (k_1 + k_2 + k_3)^\mu \ .
\end{align}
\textsc{Hint:} Start by writing the conservation of four-momentum at each vertex. Those are three equations
%\footnote{...well, 3$\times$4 equations if you count each component separately...} 
with unspecified $q_1^\mu$ and $q_2^\mu$. Use two equations to determine what these virtual momenta are, then plug them into the last equation to prove the above relation.

\section{\texorpdfstring{QED+$\mu$}{QED plus Muon}}

Here are the Feynman rules for ``QED+$\mu$,'' a theory of electrons, photons, and a second type of matter: muons, denoted $\mu$. Muons have the same charge as electrons and so the strength of their vertex with the photon is exactly the same. What are the conserved charges in this theory?

\textsc{Hint:} as you can guess, electric charge is conserved. However, there's a bit more to it than that. For example, $\mu^- \to e^- \gamma$ conserves electric charge. When the muon mass $m_\mu$ is larger than the photon mass, then $\mu^-\to e^-\gamma$ is even kinematically allowed. However, this process cannot happen dynamically in the theory QED+$\mu$. 

\textsc{Comment:} Professor Tanedo's early Ph.D research focused on this process for theories with extra dimensions.\footnote{\url{https://arxiv.org/abs/1004.2037}}
